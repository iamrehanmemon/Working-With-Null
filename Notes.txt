Reference & VAlue Tpe Overview
Magic numbers can be used to deal with null values. The magic numbers need to be set in the program.
Need to use the same set of magic number through out the code base.

Another way to deal with Null Values is Nullable of T struct.
Refactoring Magic Numbers to Nullable value type eg Nullable<bool>
C# shorthand for Nullable Values is to replace Nullable<bool> to bool?
